A cryptocurrency is a data string that has been encrypted and represents a unit of currency. It is monitored and organized by a peer-to-peer network known as a blockchain, which also functions as a secure ledger of transactions such as buying, selling, and transferring. Cryptocurrencies, unlike physical money, are decentralized, which means they are not issued by governments or other financial institutions.\
<br><br>\
Cryptocurrencies are created (and secured) through cryptographic algorithms that are maintained and confirmed in a process known as mining, in which transactions are processed and validated by a network of computers or specialized hardware such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The process rewards the miners who power the network with cryptocurrency.", "<br><br><br><br><b><br>\
A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among computer network nodes. A blockchain, like a database, stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their critical role in cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin in keeping a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The blockchain's innovation is that it ensures the fidelity and security of a data record and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.\
<br><br>\
Blockchain's goal is to enable digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. A blockchain, in this sense, serves as the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be changed, deleted, or destroyed. As a result, blockchains are also referred to as distributed ledger technology (DLT).\
<br><br>\
Due to the  decentralized structure of Bitcoin's blockchain, all transactions may be examined in real time by running a personal node or using blockchain explorers. Each node has its own copy of the chain, which is updated as new blocks are added and confirmed. This means you could follow Bitcoin wherever it goes if you wanted to.", "<br><br>\
Investing/Buying in crypto is not as hard as it seems. You can buy crypto through exchanges and stockbrokers, or from other owners. Regardless of where you obtain it, one must consider the risks of investing in digital assets.\
<br><br>\
 1. Deciding where to buy cryto\
 <br>\
 Crypto exchanges: You can buy crypto from a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges. Many provide dozens of cryptocurrency options, whereas others only provide Bitcoin and a few others. They come with a variety of different fees and consumer protections, so do your research before making a decision.\
 <Br><Br>\
 Traditional stockbrokers:There are currently few options among traditional brokers that allow customers to buy and sell Bitcoin — Robinhood was the first mainstream investment broker to offer bitcoin (Robinhood Crypto is available in most, but not all, U.S. states). Robinhood, like its stock-trading platform, does not charge fees for Bitcoin trades. Some other brokers to consider are Binance, Coinbase, eToro, and SoFi\
 <br><br>\
2. Preparing to pay <Br>\
Setting up a cryptocurrency account takes minutes, but you'll need to provide some information, including your Social Security number and the number to your bank account, debit card or credit card to fund your Bitcoin account. Some providers also may require you to have a picture ID. Record and safeguard any new passwords for your crypto account or digital wallet\
<br><br>\
3. Storing Crypto\
<br>\
Bitcoin can be stored in two kinds of digital wallets: a hot wallet or a cold wallet. With a hot wallet, transactions generally are faster, while a cold wallet often incorporates extra security steps that help to keep your assets safe but also make transactions take longer.\
", "<br><br><br><br><b><br>\
When purchasing Crypto, you want a space where it can be stored. Due to the fact that crypto is decentrlized, you cannot store it in a traditional bank, you will need something called a wallet. There are two types of wallets; hot and cold. <br><br>\
Hot wallets<br>\
With a hot wallet, Bitcoin is stored in the cloud by a trusted exchange or provider and accessed via an app or computer browser on the internet. Any trading exchange you join will provide you with a free bitcoin hot wallet in which your purchases will be automatically saved. Many users, however, prefer to transfer and store their Bitcoin with a third-party hot wallet provider, which is also typically free to download and use. While supporters claim that the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin is more secure than traditional electronic money transfers, Bitcoin hot wallets are a tempting target for hackers.\
<br><br>\
Cold wallets<br>\
A cold wallet, also known as a hardware wallet or cold storage, is a physical device that stores your cryptocurrency offline. Many resemble USB drives.\
Taking your holdings offline protects them from hacking and online attacks, but it also increases the risk of losing your holdings. This type of storage has no backup; if you misplace your wallet, you lose access to your investments. Cold wallets can also cost up to $200, though there are definitely cheaper options.\
While hacking is much more difficult with a cold wallet, it is still possible. Buy your hardware wallet directly from the manufacturer rather than secondhand, as the device may have been tampered with in a way that makes it vulnerable.", "<br><br><br><br><b><br>\
Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoins and putting them into circulation. It is also how the network confirms new transactions and is an important part of the blockchain ledger's upkeep and development. Mining is done with sophisticated hardware that solves a very complex computational math problem. The first computer to solve the problem receives the next block of bitcoins, and the process is restarted.\
<br><br>\
The term mining in blockchain refers to the computational work that nodes in the network perform in the hopes of earning new tokens. In reality, miners are being compensated for their work as auditors. They are in charge of determining the legitimacy of Bitcoin transactions. This convention was devised by Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, to keep Bitcoin users honest. 1 Miners help to prevent the double-spending problem by verifying transactions.\
 A case of double spending occurs when a Bitcoin owner spends the same bitcoin twice.\
 <br><br>\
 There is no advanced math or computation involved. You may have heard that miners solve difficult mathematical problems—this is correct, but not because the math is difficult. They are attempting to be the first miner to generate a 64-digit hexadecimal called a hash that is less than or equal to the target hash. It's all based on guesswork.", "<br><b><br>\
Cryptocurrency exchange fees can add up quickly. You may think you're only spending a few dollars here and there, but those pennies add up – and they can seriously eat into your profits. Because there is little standardization across platforms, it is difficult to make direct fee comparisons. One exchange may charge a higher deposit fee but provide low-cost withdrawals. Another may appear to offer free trading but provides poor exchange rates.\
<br><br>\
Deposit fees<br>\
Some cryptocurrency exchanges promote a variety of deposit methods, ranging from bank transfers to credit or debit card deposits and PayPal transfers. However, keep in mind that transferring money directly from your bank is frequently free, whereas credit or debit cards can incur a 2% to 5% fee. To deposit money via PayPal, you must pay a fee of 2.5 percent or more.\
You may have to buy cryptocurrency directly rather than depositing money to trade later. This combines a deposit fee and a trading fee, and the amount charged is not always clear.\
<br><br>\
Trading fee<br>\
Trading fees are best viewed as a premium paid for investment services. When you buy or sell shares of a specific investment, trading fees apply. This fee, also known as a commission, is paid to the broker in exchange for facilitating the trade through the platform. When You buy crypto on a specific software, they will charge a percentage because you have used their service to acquire crypto.\
<br><br>\
Withdraw Fee<br>\
for each withdraw, servers may charge a small flat fee to cover the transaction cost of moving the crypto out of the hot wallet to somewhere else. Withdrawals rates are determined by the blockchain network and can fluctuate without notice due to factors such as network congestion.", "<br><br><br><br><b><br>\
Yield farming is a means of earning interest on your crypto, kind of like how you'd earn interest on any money in your savings account.Much like depositing money in a bank, yield farming involves locking up your cryptocurrency, called staking, for a period of time in exchange for interest or other rewards, such as more cryptocurrency.\
<br><br>\
Yield farming works by first allowing an investor to stake their coins by depositing them into a lending protocol through a decentralized app. Some staking platforms include eToro, uniswap, and coinbase.\
Other investors can then borrow the coins through the decentralized app to use for speculation, where they try to profit off of sharp swings they anticipate in the coin's market price.<br><br>\
Investors who lock up their coins on the yield-farming protocol can earn interest and often more cryptocurrency coins. In addition, If the price of those additional coins appreciates, the investor's returns rise as well. "];
