let Facts = ["<br><br><br><br>A Roth IRA is an Individual Retirement Account to which you contribute after-tax dollars. While there are no current-year tax benefits, your contributions and earnings can grow tax-free, and you can withdraw them tax- and penalty-free after age 59.5 and once the account has been open for five years. As with any eligible retirement account, money invested in a Roth IRA is tax exempt. However, Roth IRAs are less restrictive than other accounts. Account holders can maintain Roth IRA indefinitely. There is no minimum lifetime allocation (RMD) required for a lifetime like a 401 (k) or a traditional IRA. <br><br>Once the account is funded, there are various investment options  within RothIRA, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), deposit certificates (CDs),  money market funds, and even cryptocurrencies. The IRS states that cryptocurrencies cannot be deposited directly into the Roth IRA. However, with the recent advent of Bitcoin IRA, a retirement account has been created that allows you to  invest in cryptocurrencies. The IRS also lists other assets that are not allowed within the IRA such as Life insurance contracts and derivative trades. <br><br>If you want a wide range of investment options, you need to open a Roth Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA). This is a special category of RothIRA where investors, not  financial institutions, manage their investments. These open up the world of possible investment. In addition to  standard investments (stocks, bonds, cash, money market funds,  mutual funds), you can hold assets that are not normally part of your retirement portfolio. Some of these include gold, investment real estate, partnerships, tax liens and even franchise businesses.", "<br><br><br><br>The 401 (k) plan is a retirement  plan offered by many American employers and offers tax incentives to savers. Named after a part of the United States. The name is the Internal Revenue Code. Employees who sign up for a 401 (k) agree to deposit a percentage of each salary directly into their investment account. The employer may pay all or part  of this contribution. Employees can choose from many investment options, usually investment trusts.In a traditional 401 (k), employee contributions are deducted from your total income. That is, money is deducted from the employee gross income before income tax is deducted. As a result, the employee's taxable income is reduced by the total amount of contributions for the year and can be reported as a tax credit for that tax year. No tax is levied on the money  or income deposited until the worker normally withdraws the money at retirement. <br><br>A 401(k) is a type of defined contribution retirement plan. Contributions to the account can be made by both the employee and the employer up to the financial restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A defined contribution plan, also termed as a defined-benefit plan by the IRS, is an alternative to the traditional pension. With a pension, the company agrees to pay the employee a set sum of money for the rest of his or her life.<br><br>Employers have moved the duty and risk of saving for retirement to their employees, resulting in the rise of 401(k) plans and the decline of traditional pensions in recent decades. Employees are also responsible for selecting specific investments for their 401(k) accounts from a list provided by their company. Those options usually include a mix of stock and bond mutual funds, as well as target-date funds, which are meant to decrease the risk of investment losses as the employee nears retirement.They may also include guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) issued by insurance companies and sometimes the employer's own stock.", "<br><br><br><br>It’s worth noting that an investor can have both a Roth and a traditional IRA and contribute to both, but the contribution limits apply across all IRAs.<br><br>Contribution limitations for the Roth IRA are $6,000 in 2021 and 2022. In both 2021 and 2022, if you're 50 or older, you can give an extra $1,000 as a catch-up payment.  Contributions, not profits, are tax-free and can be withdrawn at any time.<br><br>The maximum amount that an individual or company can contribute to a 401(k) plan is increased on a regular basis to account for inflation, which is a metric that monitors an economy's rising prices. Employee contributions are capped at $19,500 per year for workers under the age of 50 in 2021, and $20,500 per year in 2022. In 2021 and 2022, however, persons aged 50 and older can make a $6,500 catch-up contribution.<br><br>Contributions to an IRA are not restricted by age. Roth IRA contributions have never had an age limit, although regular IRA contributions used to have an age limit of 7012.   With the enactment of the SECURE (Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement) Act of 2019, that limit was lifted. <br><br>Your capacity to contribute to a traditional IRA is determined by your eligibility to enroll in a qualified retirement plan (QRP), such as a 401(k). Participation in a QRP has no bearing on a Roth IRA."];
