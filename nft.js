Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets that live on a blockchain. Each NFT unique identification code and metadata that distinguish them from each other. The popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) skyrocketed in early 2021, even though they have existed on various blockchains since 2012. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. This differs from fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, which are identical to each other and, therefore, can serve as a medium for commercial transactions. Almost anything can be tokenized, and NFTs have invaded a variety of industries, including art, fashion, sports, alcohol, and e-gaming.\
", "<br><br><br><br><b><br>\
Like physical money, cryptocurrencies are fungible. Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type Likewise, cryptocurrencies can be exchanged or exchanged with each other. For example, Bitcoin is always worth the same as another Bitcoin. Similarly, one unit of ether is always the same as another. Due to this fungible nature, cryptocurrencies are suitable as a secure trading medium  in the digital economy.\
<br><br>\
NFT changes the cryptographic paradigm by making each token unique and irreplaceable,  making it impossible to make one token look like another. These are digital representations of assets that are compared to digital passports because each token contains a unique, non-transferable ID that distinguishes it from other tokens. NFTs are also extensible; You can combine one NFT with another to breed a third unique NFT.\
<br><br>\
NFTs, like Bitcoin, include ownership information for easy identification and transfer between token holders. Owners can also include metadata or asset attributes in NFTs. Tokens resembling coffee beans, for example, can be classified as fair trade. Artists can also sign their digital artwork in the metadata with their own signature.\
<br><br>\
Non-fungible tokens, which use blockchain technology in the same way that cryptocurrency does, are generally safe. NFTs are difficult (but not impossible) to hack due to the distributed nature of blockchains. One security risk associated with NFTs is that you may lose access to your non-fungible token if the platform that hosts the NFT goes out of business.", "\
Because the asset class is new, determining the precise value of an NFT is difficult. While tangible artworks such as the Mona Lisa and physical collectibles such as NBA player cards have established values, investors considering NFTs may struggle to determine whether a given asset or collectible is worth their money and whether they truly want or need it.\
However, as NFTs make their way into a variety of industries in less than a year and reach high levels of valuation, three key factors for determining their worth have emerged.\
<br><br>\
Rarity<br>\
This factor literally translates into how rare and hard-to-get a specific NFT is. A first-of-its-kind artwork by a famous creator in the digital arts industry, or an NFT created by a famous celebrity, are both examples of rarity.\
Rarity is important because it directly correlates with the excitement and price of an NFT. Rarity also drives demand in an NFT project and diversifies it by providing different levels of traits and utility.\
A jacket, hat, facial expression, and what the character is holding in their mouth are all examples of trait categories. Each category would then have a specific number of unique traits, and each unique trait would appear a specific number of times in the NFT collection.\
<br><br>\
Utility<br>\
The utility of an NFT stems from its actual application, whether in the physical or digital worlds. Some NFTs, for example, are more than just collectibles because they can be used in games as virtual lands, spells, or characters. This feature of NFTs provides them with immediate value, which accrues over time based on the popularity of the underlying project. As the community of players in a decentralized game grows, more of them will be willing to pay top dollar for a one-of-a-kind card.\
<br><br>\
Tangibility<br>\
Some NFTs are linked to physical objects, providing value in the form of tangibility backed by ownership immutability. In essence, anything can be backed by an NFT to secure ownership rights, but this does not make the object unique or valuable. The underlying value of such an object will be determined by its usefulness, scarcity, and the level of personal satisfaction it provides users.\
In terms of market practicality, having an NFT ticket to an exclusive event full of celebrities, for example, is significantly more valuable; such NFTs with tangible value are best suited for short-term trading on the marketplace. This is due to the fact that such NFTs, like tickets, may have expiry dates.\
Other collectibles, such as NFT-tethered limited edition sneakers, can gain value over time as the number of items in circulation decreases.", "<br><br><br><br><b><br>\
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are only now making inroads into the mainstream. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have quickly gained popularity as one popular application, particularly among artists, art collectors, and speculators. If you've decided you want a piece of the NFT action but don't know how to get started, here's how.\
<br><br>\
Purchase Ethereum on a crypto exchange:<br>\
An NFT is a token that represents ownership of an asset and is built and managed on a blockchain (most commonly Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)). As a result, most NFTs require payment in Ethereum or another cryptocurrency blockchain where they are built.\
<br><br>\
Transfer crypto:<br>\
Transfer your cryptocurrency to a cryptocurrency wallet. Consider it a digital checking account for storing and transferring cryptocurrency. Some exchanges, such as Coinbase, include built-in wallet features when you open an account, but other options include dedicated wallets such as MetaMask.\
<br><br>\
Connect your wallet to an NFT marketplace:<br>\
There are numerous NFT marketplaces. The largest is currently OpenSea, which primarily uses Ethereum but also supports over 150 other payment tokens. Binance NFT, Rarible, and Foundation are three other NFT marketplaces with a diverse selection of art and collectibles.\
Some marketplaces specialize in a narrower range of assets. The Musician Marketplace, for example, focuses on music compositions, whereas NBA Top Shot is the National Basketball Association's officially licensed marketplace for purchasing digital video highlights.\
There's a marketplace for whatever you're looking for, whether it's art, collectibles, video game assets, or website domain names. ", "<br><br><br><br><b><br>\
When purchasing NFTs, there a a numerous amount of fees that buyers should be aware of, below are a few main types of fees that buyer should know.\
<br><br>\
Gas Fee<br>\
When you conduct a blockchain transaction, you must pay a fee. This fee is known as a gas price. You are essentially paying a miner to go out and collect cryptocurrency for you. You can choose to pay higher transaction fees for faster transaction speeds or lower transaction fees for slower transaction speeds.\
Gas prices are one of the most significant challenges confronting cryptocurrency markets. If we can find a better way to reduce transaction energy costs, crypto will become more common. Gas fee can also fluctuate though out the day; it all depends on the traffic of transactions\
<br><br>\
Transaction Fee<br>\
This fee is very easy and simple to understand. There are often fees for buying or selling an NFT on a marketplace. OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, charges 2.5% per transaction. Marketplaces will incur these fees becasuse you use their service in order to obtain the NFT.\
<br><br>\
Royalty Fee\
<br>\
Payments received by musicians when their original songs are played on the radio or television, used in movies, performed at concerts, bars, and restaurants, or consumed via streaming services are examples of royalties. A royalty is a legally binding payment made to an individual or company for the continued use of their assets, which may include copyrighted works, franchises, or natural resources. The oringnal artist of the NFt are legally able to charge a royalty fee everytime their NFT is sold. On opensea, Artist can charge up to 10% Royalty per NFT that gets exchaged over and over.", "<br><br><br>\
Non-fungible tokens are the next step in the evolution of the relatively simple concept of cryptocurrencies. Modern finance systems are made up of sophisticated trading and loan systems for various asset types, such as real estate, lending contracts, and artwork. NFTs are a step forward in the reinvention of this infrastructure because they enable digital representations of physical assets.\
<br><br>\
The most obvious advantage of NFTs is market efficiency. Converting a physical asset to a digital asset streamlines processes and eliminates intermediaries. NFTs on a blockchain representing digital or physical artwork eliminate the need for agents and allow artists to connect directly with their audiences. They can also be used to improve business processes. An NFT for a discount at a pizza shop, for example, will make it benefitÂ both parties. The holder of the NFT will get discount pizza for as long as they hold the NFT. If the Holder get tired of pizza, they can sell the NFT. Upon being sold the owner of the pizza shop will get a percentage of royalty.\
<br><br>\
Non-fungible tokens are also useful in identity management. Consider the case of physical passports, which must be produced at every point of entry and exit. Individual passports can be converted into NFTs, each with its own unique identifying characteristics, allowing jurisdictions to streamline entry and exit processes. In addition to this use case, NFTs can be used for identity management in the digital realm.\
<br><br>\
The creation of new markets and forms of investment is the most exciting possibility for NFTs. Consider a piece of real estate divided into multiple divisions, each with its own set of characteristics and property types. One division may be near a beach, another in an entertainment complex, and yet another in a residential district. Each piece of land is unique, priced differently, and represented by an NFT based on its characteristics. The incorporation of relevant metadata into each unique NFT can help to simplify real estate trading, which is a complex and bureaucratic affair."];
