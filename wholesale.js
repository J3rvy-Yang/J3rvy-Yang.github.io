let Facts = ["Real estate investing is not the same as stock and bond investing. You can start trading with as little as $100 and exit whenever you choose with these two markets. When it comes to real estate, however, it's not so simple. In reality, it may be difficult to navigate and frequently comes at a high cost. Buying and selling a home also takes time. First, there's the matter of saving up for a down payment, obtaining financing, completing all of the necessary paperwork, and finally closing. Not to mention the amount of time you'll need to deal with tenants and collect rent.<br><br>You still have a few options if you really want to make money in real estate but can't imagine saving up all that money and going with the purchasing procedure. One of them is real estate wholesaling. It's a legal method you can employ to your benefit without ever making a buying offer or putting down a deposit. So, how does it function?<br><br>Investors utilize real estate wholesaling as a short-term business technique to achieve large profits. Contrary to popular belief, real estate wholesaling is unrelated to retail wholesaling. The wholesaler sells a big number of items to a retailer, who then repackages and sells it to consumers at a much higher price. The wholesaler can charge the retailer a substantially lower price because of the amount of goods sold to the retailer.<br><br>Real estate wholesaling does not entail the simultaneous sale of many properties at reduced prices. It's a completely diffrent game. In this technique, the distributor contracts a distressed home with a seller, shops it around to possible buyers, and then assigns the contract to one of them.<br><br>Wholesaling real estate is great for those who wish to enter into the industry but lack the financial means to do so. One of the best things about becoming a wholesaler is that you don't need to attend a course, pass an exam, or obtain a real estate license. Wholesaling could be a good fit for you if you have good people skills and are patient.", "<br><br><br>Real estate wholesale can sound complicated, however the concept is not as difficult as you may think. <br><br>Let's use this example to explain.<br> Suppose a homeowner owns a property that he didn't expect to sell because it was in such a bad condition. The Owners may not have the finiancial resources to fix it themselves, but they continue to live there and believe they will never get a fair price for it. Then a wholesaler to approach the homeowner with an offer to buy the property. Together they agree to contract the house  for $ 90,000. In his network of investors, he found an all cash buyer willing to pay $ 100,000 for the propeerty. The wholesaler then sells the contract to this investor, who  has a profitable Fixerupper project. The Wholesaler will then make a  profit of $ 10,000 without  owning a home. <br><br> This example shows that the wholesaler has never actually made an offer to buy. He agreed to lend the homeowners home to a future buyer. Under the contract, the buyer pays  the wholesaler $ 100,000, the wholesaler pays the homeowner $ 90,000, and keeps the rest  as a profit.", "Make Money In Less Time<br>Wholesale can be a very lucrative business if you do due diligence to make money in less time and educate yourself about the process.

In some wholesale transactions you will know what to look for in a transaction and what to avoid.<br><br>No Credit Involved And Little Cash Required<br>Wholesale is a good option if your investment in real estate is hindered by low credit  or limited access to capital. Even if you have a low credit rating, you can still participate in a wholesale contract because you usually do not buy the property. Instead, assign a purchase agreement to the final purchaser who needs to fund the purchase  through  credit verification. However, wholesale is not without its potential downsides.", "There is no guaranteed income<br>Wholesale is not a typical ninety-five job.

The best you can do is to secure money for a rainy day fund if the transaction does not go as planned.<br><br>Difficulty of finding a investor<br> The key to  a successful wholesaler is  a solid list of buyers. In the wholesale world, having no buyers means having no transactions. In addition, your personal risk depends on how your contract is written.
